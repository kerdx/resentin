/**
 * #360 — cicchetto port: mention-aware jump-to-bottom badge geometry.
 *
 * Mirror of cicchetto's `mentionScroll.ts`. Resentin renders one row per
 * message entity and — like cicchetto's unread-divider bump — inserts a single
 * divider row in front of the first unread message, so message `i` occupies
 * list index `i (+1 if the divider precedes it)`. `mentionRowIndices` are the
 * ASCENDING list indices of the mention rows (every row a hilight/watch pattern
 * marks from a sender other than the operator's own nick — the SAME rows the
 * per-row highlight paints, `isMentionRow`).
 *
 * "Below the fold" is cicchetto's rule verbatim: a mention counts once its row
 * lies ENTIRELY past the last laid-out row; one straddling the fold has its top
 * above the viewport end and is therefore already seen. The row-index gate
 * `index > lastVisibleRowIndex` agrees with it — a mention at the fold has
 * index == lastVisibleRowIndex and is dropped either way, and any mention
 * beyond the last laid-out row starts strictly below it.
 *
 * The boolean this produces is a pure function of list indices — no DOM
 * geometry read — so it ports cleanly onto Resentin's LazyColumn layout info
 * and stays unit-testable, exactly like the cicchetto module it mirrors.
